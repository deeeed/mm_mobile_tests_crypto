# test1
- latest rn: "react-native": "0.71.0"
- main example with latest react native version
- doesn't use rn-nodeify
- works decently well with iphone
- EXTREMELY slow encryption for android

# test2
- doesn't work!!!
- rn-nodeify / react-native-randombytes not compatible with react native 0.70+


# test3
- use react native v0.67 (similar to previous sdk example)
- works decently for both iphone and android
- works exactly like previous example --> conclusion problem is not from the refactoring but from incompatible latest RN versions.


## Setup
- each RN needs a different ruby version to be working, the best way to manage the different versions is to use `asdf` and switch between projects
    - ruby 2.7.6 for RN 0.71.0
    - ruby 2.7.5 for RN 0.67
```bash
# install compatible ruby versions
 asdf install ruby 2.7.6    
 asdf install ruby 2.7.5    
 asdf install ruby 2.7.4
 # it will then automatically switch to the correct version in each example folder
```

- Make sure to edit the path to latest sdk versions in the `hackit.sh` script that will replace sdk and comm-layer libraries.
- Make sure to test with your local socket server, changing the ngrok url after `ngrok http http://localhost:5400`

## Check rn-nodeify issue on android
```bash
npx react-native init test4
cd test4
yarn add rn-nodeify react-native-randombytes react-native-crypto
## as soon as you run rn-nodeify the project will not build on android
yarn rn-nodeify --hack --install --yarn
# on terminal1:
yarn start
# on terminal2:
yarn android
#### see the errors...
```
